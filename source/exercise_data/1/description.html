In order to start working with segment tree we need to create an array which will hold its data. To make segment tree code simpler it makes sense to extend the input size array and make its size equal to the smallest power of 2 no less than the original size. So the first warm-up exercise would be to calculate this "extended" size of the array given the original input size.
